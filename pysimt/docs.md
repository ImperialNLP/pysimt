`pysimt` includes two state-of-the-art S2S approaches to neural machine
translation (NMT) to begin with:

* [RNN-based attentive NMT (Bahdanau et al. 2014)]
* [Self-attention based Transformers NMT (Vaswani et al. 2017)]

The toolkit mostly emphasizes on multimodal machine translation (MMT), and
therefore the above models easily accomodate multiple source modalities
through [encoder-side (Caglayan et al. 2020)] and [decoder-side multimodal attention (Caglayan et al. 2016)] approaches.

Installation
------------
Essentially, `pysimt` requires `Python>=3.7` and `torch>=1.7.0`. You can access
the other dependencies in the provided `environment.yml` file.

The following command will create an appropriate Anaconda environment with `pysimt`
installed in editable mode. This will allow you to modify to code in the GIT
checkout folder, and then run the experiments directly.

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

.. note::
  If you want to use the METEOR metric for early-stopping or the `pysimt-coco-metrics`
  script to evaluate your models' performance, you need to run the `pysimt-install-extra`
  script within the **pysimt** Anaconda environment. This will download and install
  the METEOR paraphrase files under the `~/.pysimt` folder.


Command-line tools
------------------
Once installed, you will have access to three command line utilities:

### pysimt

### pysimt-build-vocab

### pysimt-coco-metrics

What objects are documented?
----------------------------
[public-private]: #what-objects-are-documented
`pdoc` only extracts _public API_ documentation.[^public]
Code objects (modules, variables, functions, classes, methods) are considered
public in the modules where they are defined (vs. imported from somewhere else)
as long as their _identifiers don't begin with an underscore_ ( \_ ).[^private]
If a module defines [`__all__`][__all__], then only the identifiers contained
in this list are considered public, regardless of where they were defined.

This can be fine-tuned through [`__pdoc__` dict][__pdoc__].

[^public]:
    Here, public API refers to the API that is made available
    to your project end-users, not the public API e.g. of a
    private class that can be reasonably extended elsewhere
    by your project developers.

[^private]:
    Prefixing private, implementation-specific objects with
    an underscore is [a common convention].

[a common convention]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables

[__all__]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package


Where does `pdoc` get documentation from?
-----------------------------------------
In Python, objects like modules, functions, classes, and methods
have a special attribute `__doc__` which contains that object's
documentation string ([docstring][docstrings]).
For example, the following code defines a function with a docstring
and shows how to access its contents:

    >>> def test():
    ...     """This is a docstring."""
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> test.__doc__
    'This is a docstring.'

It's pretty much the same with classes and modules.
See [PEP-257] for Python docstring conventions.

[PEP-257]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

These docstrings are set as descriptions for each module, class,
function, and method listed in the documentation produced by `pdoc`.

`pdoc` extends the standard use of docstrings in Python in two
important ways: by allowing methods to inherit docstrings, and
by introducing syntax for docstrings for variables.


### Docstrings inheritance
[docstrings inheritance]: #docstrings-inheritance

`pdoc` considers methods' docstrings inherited from superclass methods',
following the normal class inheritance patterns.
Consider the following code example:

    >>> class A:
    ...     def test(self):
    ...         """Docstring for A."""
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> class B(A):
    ...     def test(self):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> A.test.__doc__
    'Docstring for A.'
    >>> B.test.__doc__
    None

In Python, the docstring for `B.test` doesn't exist, even though a
docstring was defined for `A.test`.
Contrary, when `pdoc` generates documentation for code such as above,
it will automatically attach the docstring for `A.test` to
`B.test` if the latter doesn't define its own.
In the default HTML template, such inherited docstrings are greyed out.


### Docstrings for variables
[variable docstrings]: #docstrings-for-variables

Python by itself [doesn't allow docstrings attached to variables][PEP-224].
However, `pdoc` supports docstrings attached to module (or global)
variables, class variables, and object instance variables; all in
the same way as proposed in [PEP-224], with a docstring following the
variable assignment.
For example:

[PEP-224]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0224

    module_variable = 1
    """Docstring for module_variable."""

    class C:
        class_variable = 2
        """Docstring for class_variable."""

        def __init__(self):
            self.variable = 3
            """Docstring for instance variable."""

While the resulting variables have no `__doc__` attribute,
`pdoc` compensates by reading the source code (when available)
and parsing the syntax tree.

By convention, variables defined in a class' `__init__` method
and attached to `self` are considered and documented as
_instance_ variables.

Class and instance variables can also [inherit docstrings][docstrings inheritance].


Overriding docstrings with `__pdoc__`
-------------------------------------
[__pdoc__]: #overriding-docstrings-with-__pdoc__
Docstrings for objects can be disabled, overridden, or whitelisted with a special
module-level dictionary `__pdoc__`. The _keys_
should be string identifiers within the scope of the module or,
alternatively, fully-qualified reference names. E.g. for instance
variable `self.variable` of class `C`, its module-level identifier is
`'C.variable'`, and `some_package.module.C.variable` its refname.

If `__pdoc__[key] = False`, then `key` (and its members) will be
**excluded from the documentation** of the module.

Conversely, if `__pdoc__[key] = True`, then `key` (and its public members) will be
**included in the documentation** of the module. This can be used to
include documentation of [private objects][public-private],
including special functions such as `__call__`, which are ignored by default.

Alternatively, the _values_ of `__pdoc__` can be the **overriding docstrings**.
This feature is useful when there's no feasible way of
attaching a docstring to something. A good example is a
[namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple):

    __pdoc__ = {}

    Table = namedtuple('Table', ['types', 'names', 'rows'])
    __pdoc__['Table.types'] = 'Types for each column in the table.'
    __pdoc__['Table.names'] = 'The names of each column in the table.'
    __pdoc__['Table.rows'] = 'Lists corresponding to each row in the table.'

`pdoc` will then show `Table` as a class with documentation for the
`types`, `names` and `rows` members.

.. note::
    The assignments to `__pdoc__` need to be placed where they'll be
    executed when the module is imported. For example, at the top level
    of a module or in the definition of a class.


Supported docstring formats
---------------------------
[docstring-formats]: #supported-docstring-formats
Currently, pure Markdown (with [extensions]), [numpydoc],
and [Google-style] docstrings formats are supported,
along with some [reST directives].

Additionally, if `latex_math` [template config][custom templates] option is enabled,
LaTeX math syntax is supported when placed between
[recognized delimiters]: `\(...\)` for inline equations and
`\[...\]` or `$$...$$` for block equations. Note, you need to escape
your backslashes in Python docstrings (`\\(`, `\\frac{}{}`, ...)
or, alternatively, use [raw string literals].

*[reST]: reStructuredText
[extensions]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/#officially-supported-extensions
[numpydoc]: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/
[Google-style]: http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings
[recognized delimiters]: https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/delimiters.html
[raw string literals]: https://www.journaldev.com/23598/python-raw-string


### Supported reST directives
[reST directives]: #supported-rest-directives

The following reST directives should work:

* specific and generic [admonitions] (attention, caution, danger,
  error, hint, important, note, tip, warning, admonition),
* [`.. image::`][image] or `.. figure::` (without options),
* [`.. include::`][include], with support for the options:
  `:start-line:`, `:end-line:`, `:start-after:` and `:end-before:`.
* [`.. math::`][math]
* `.. versionadded::`
* `.. versionchanged::`
* `.. deprecated::`
* `.. todo::`

[admonitions]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#admonitions
[image]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#images
[include]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#including-an-external-document-fragment
[math]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#math


Linking to other identifiers
----------------------------
[cross-linking]: #linking-to-other-identifiers
In your documentation, you may refer to other identifiers in
your modules. When exporting to HTML, linking is automatically
done whenever you surround an identifier with [backticks] ( \` ).
Unless within the current module,
the identifier name must be fully qualified, for example
<code>\`pdoc.Doc.docstring\`</code> is correct (and will link to
`pdoc.Doc.docstring`) while <code>\`Doc.docstring\`</code>
only works within `pdoc` module.

[backticks]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent#Use_in_programming


Command-line interface
----------------------
[cmd]: #command-line-interface
`pdoc` includes a feature-rich "binary" program for producing
HTML and plain text documentation of your modules.
For example, to produce HTML documentation of your whole package
in subdirectory 'build' of the current directory, using the default
HTML template, run:

    $ pdoc --html --output-dir build my_package

If you want to omit the source code preview, run:

    $ pdoc --html --config show_source_code=False my_package

Find additional template configuration tunables in [custom templates]
section below.

To run a local HTTP server while developing your package or writing
docstrings for it, run:

    $ pdoc --http : my_package

To re-build documentation as part of your continuous integration (CI)
best practice, i.e. ensuring all reference links are correct and
up-to-date, make warnings error loudly by settings the environment
variable [`PYTHONWARNINGS`][PYTHONWARNINGS] before running pdoc:

    $ export PYTHONWARNINGS='error::UserWarning'

[PYTHONWARNINGS]: https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONWARNINGS

For brief usage instructions, type:

    $ pdoc --help

Even more usage examples can be found in the [FAQ].

[FAQ]: https://github.com/pdoc3/pdoc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion


Programmatic usage
------------------
The main entry point is `pdoc.Module` which wraps a module object
and recursively imports and wraps any submodules and their members.

After all related modules are wrapped (related modules are those that
share the same `pdoc.Context`), you need to call
`pdoc.link_inheritance` with the used `Context` instance to
establish class inheritance links.

Afterwards, you can use `pdoc.Module.html` and `pdoc.Module.text`
methods to output documentation in the desired format.
For example:

    import pdoc

    modules = ['a', 'b']  # Public submodules are auto-imported
    context = pdoc.Context()

    modules = [pdoc.Module(mod, context=context)
               for mod in modules]
    pdoc.link_inheritance(context)

    def recursive_htmls(mod):
        yield mod.name, mod.html()
        for submod in mod.submodules():
            yield from recursive_htmls(submod)

    for mod in modules:
        for module_name, html in recursive_htmls(mod):
            ...  # Process

When documenting a single module, you might find
functions `pdoc.html` and `pdoc.text` handy.
For importing arbitrary modules/files, use `pdoc.import_module`.

Alternatively, use the [runnable script][cmd] included with this package.


Custom templates
----------------
[custom templates]: #custom-templates
To override the built-in HTML/CSS and plain text templates, copy
the relevant templates from `pdoc/templates` directory into a directory
of your choosing and edit them. When you run [pdoc command][cmd]
afterwards, pass the directory path as a parameter to the
`--template-dir` switch.

.. tip::
    If you find you only need to apply minor alterations to the HTML template,
    see if you can do so by overriding just some of the following, placeholder
    sub-templates:

    * [_config.mako_]: Basic template configuration, affects the way templates
      are rendered.
    * _head.mako_: Included just before `</head>`. Best for adding resources and styles.
    * _logo.mako_: Included at the very top of the navigation sidebar. Empty by default.
    * _credits.mako_: Included in the footer, right before pdoc version string.

    See [default template files] for reference.

.. tip::
   You can also alter individual [_config.mako_] preferences using the
   `--config` command-line switch.

If working with `pdoc` programmatically, _prepend_ the directory with
modified templates into the `directories` list of the
`pdoc.tpl_lookup` object.

[_config.mako_]: https://github.com/pdoc3/pdoc/blob/master/pdoc/templates/config.mako
